# Topseller: Demo E-Commerce Site

## Overview
This project was made by enhancing the final submission of the React Training project given by Internshala, the Platzi Fake Store API was used instead of their provided assets due to the extremely low length of the dataset provided by Internshala.

## Features

1. Full webapp is responsive and built using MaterialUI and React.

2. Webapp allows the user to filter through all the entries as per their desired categories of data.

3. The API is only called twice at each rendering of the home page and the data is stored locally from there.

4. Cart state is persisted through the use of localStorage.

5. Application consists of two pages, Home and Cart. User can navigate to the Cart page by pressing the Cart button in the header and to the Home page by pressing the logo which is also present in the header.

6. Cart shows all the items selected by the user, allows them to add, remove or delete items. Same choices are offered on the Home page by the Item cards.
